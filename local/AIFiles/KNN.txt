"""
<strong>fit</strong> indicates the training function.
fit()                     
The training function takes a single input, the training set.
Each row contains one sample, and each column is a property.
Only the internal properties of objects are modified. Therefore, this function can be called directly
to retrieve the training results. Actually, this function does not
belong to the KNeighborsClassifier class.
It is a method inherited from its parent class SupervisedIntegerMixin.

model.fit(X, y)

# Prediction
print(model.predict([[1.75, 1.75]]))  #Output the classification result.
print(model.predict_proba([[1.75, 1.75]]))  #Return the probability that an object belongs to a preset label.
print(model.score(X, y))  #Output the model training result.
